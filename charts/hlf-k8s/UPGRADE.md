# Changelog


# 10.0.0

Switch from hlf-couchdb to couchdb

# 9.0.0

This is a major verision since we drop compatibility with kubernetes versions before `1.19` but there is no big change to the values. The only thing you should pay attention to is the new `PathType` key for the `appChannels` ingresses.

# 6.0.0

Application channel chaincodes have now a [sequence](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/commands/peerlifecycle.html?highlight=sequence) field.

```yaml
chaincodes:
  - name: mycc
    address: network-org-1-peer-1-hlf-k8s-chaincode-mycc.org-1.svc.cluster.local
    port: 7052
    version: "1.0"
    image:
      repository: substrafoundation/substra-chaincode

      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent


appChannels:
- channelName: mychannel
  chaincodes:
  - name: mycc
    policy: "OR('MyOrg1MSP.member','MyOrg2MSP.member')"
    version: "1.0"
    sequence: "1"
```

# 5.0.0
