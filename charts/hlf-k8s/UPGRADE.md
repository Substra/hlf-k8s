    port: 7052
    version: "1.0"
    image:
      repository: substrafoundation/substra-chaincode
      tag: 0.1.1
      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent


appChannels:
- channelName: mychannel
  chaincodes:
  - name: mycc
    policy: "OR('MyOrg1MSP.member','MyOrg2MSP.member')"
    version: "1.0"
```

## 4.0.0


Peer use now couchdb as default instead of goleveldb
Orderer is now under etcdraft type and not solo anymore
Policies are mandatory and need to be set for : SystemChannel, Application and Channel


hlf-k8s appChannels field expose now :
 - application policies
 - channel policies
 - chaincodes, which is not isolated anymore

Rename images from hlf-k8s to fabric-tools and fabric-ca-tools

/!\ As we use TLS for chaincode and peer communications, you need to add chaincode fqdn in the csrHost of the CA enrollement
